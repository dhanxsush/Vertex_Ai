# Semantic Vector Search using AlloyDB + Vertex AI

This repository contains the output of a semantic vector search experiment
performed using AlloyDB integrated with Vertex AI text embeddings.

The search retrieves records based on semantic similarity rather than
traditional keyword matching.

## What’s included
- `semantic_search_results.csv`  
  Output from a vector similarity search query over patent data.

## Technical overview
- Database: AlloyDB (PostgreSQL-compatible)
- Embeddings: Vertex AI Gemini text embeddings (dense vectors)
- Search method: Vector similarity search (semantic intent)

This repository shares only the query output for demonstration purposes.
No cloud resources, credentials, or proprietary configurations are included.
